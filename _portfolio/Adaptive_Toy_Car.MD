This project modifies a standard toy car to improve accessibility for children with disabilities, particularly those who face challenges with motor control. The modifications include an external push button for simplified operation, a potentiometer for adjustable speed control, and a modified steering wheel for easier grip. These changes allow children with limited dexterity and mobility impairments to engage in play, fostering both independence and skill development.

## Operation

1. Hardware Setup:
    - Gas Pedal Replacement: The external push button is wired to replace the gas pedal, allowing activation by hand instead of foot.
    - Speed Control: A potentiometer is installed at the rear of the toy car, allowing parents to regulate speed.
    - Steering Wheel Modification: PVC grips improve handling and control.
    - Wiring Safety: All exposed wiring is insulated using heat shrink tubing.

2. Testing Process:
    - Functionality Tests: Ensure the external push button activates the motor properly.
    - Speed Regulation: Test the potentiometer to confirm smooth speed adjustments.
    - Durability Tests: Drop and impact tests ensure structural integrity.
    - Safety Compliance: Confirm battery compartment security and wire insulation.

3. Compliance Checks:
    - Cord length limits (<12 inches) to prevent entanglement.
    - Battery compartment requires tools to access.
    - Strain relief mechanisms prevent wire stress.
