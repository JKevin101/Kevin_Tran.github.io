This project focuses on the design and fabrication of a Pinch Flow Fractionation (PFF) microfluidic device, which sorts particles based on size using carefully controlled fluid flow patterns. The device leverages sheath flow to focus particles and uses pinch geometries to split particles into different outlets based on size.

## Purpose and Features
- Purpose: To create a functional microfluidic sorter capable of separating particles by size for applications such as medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and pharmaceutical development.
- Key Features:
  - Pinch flow geometry for controlled particle separation.
  - Dual sheath flow inlets for precise focusing.
  - Five-outlet design for size-based fractionation.
  - Fabrication using resin printing, parylene coating, and PDMS casting.

## Fabrication Process

1. 3D Printed Mold Preparation:
    - Print high-resolution mold using resin printer.
    - Clean and post-cure the mold thoroughly.

2. Parylene Coating:
    - Deposit a thin parylene layer onto the mold.
    - This prevents PDMS adhesion and ensures smooth channels.

3. PDMS Casting:
    - Mix PDMS base and curing agent.
    - Degas and pour over the coated mold.
    - Cure at 70Â°C for 2 hours, then demold.

4. Device Assembly:
    - Punch inlet and outlet ports.
    - Bond PDMS to a glass slide using oxygen plasma treatment.
    - Connect tubing to the ports for flow control.

## Design Description

### Parylene Coating
- Prevents PDMS adhesion to the resin mold.
- Provides smoother surfaces for laminar flow.
- Enhances mold reusability.

### Geometry for Sorting

| Parameter         | Value     | Purpose                                     |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pinch Width      | 0.79 mm   | Focuses particles into a single streamline |
| Broad Section    | 18 mm     | Accommodates sorted particles              |
| Inlet Ports      | 2         | Sample (center) + single sheath flow       |
| Outlet Ports     | 5         | Collects different size fractions          |

### Calculation of Outlet Positions

To ensure that particles of different sizes travel at similar speeds and follow consistent path lengths, each outlet's position is calculated using:

$$
\left( \text{Pinch Section} - 0.06875 \text{ mm} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Broad Section}}{\text{Pinch Section}} \right)
$$

$$
\left( \text{Pinch Section} - 0.23175 \text{ mm} \right) \times \left( \frac{\text{Broad Section}}{\text{Pinch Section}} \right)
$$

These equations account for different particle sizes while maintaining uniform velocity and streamline separation, ensuring optimal fractionation.
