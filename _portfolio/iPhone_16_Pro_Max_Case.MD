## Project Overview
This project showcases a 3D-printed phone case for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, designed for optimal protection and usability. By leveraging TPU material and parametric modeling, the case ensures a snug fit, button accessibility, and customizable aesthetics.

## Design Features
- Flexible TPU construction provides impact resistance while maintaining ease of installation.
- Button flaps offer thin, responsive covers that allow easy pressing without excessive force.
- Raised lip protects the screen from direct contact with surfaces.
- Detachable camera cover ensures lens protection while allowing flat-bed printing.
- SVG personalization slot enables users to insert custom designs for added customization.

## Iterative Design Process
The design evolved through multiple iterations:

### Initial Prototype
The first iteration was based on official Apple schematics. The primary focus was on achieving accurate dimensions, but the case had overly tight tolerances, making it difficult to fit onto the phone.

### Refined Model
Adjustments were made to improve the fit. The button cutouts were repositioned, and the detachable camera cover was redesigned to reduce misalignment issues. The case's thickness was also reduced slightly for better flexibility.

### Enhanced Button Accessibility
This version focused on improving button press response. The flaps covering the buttons were optimized for easier use, and additional refinements were made to the SVG insert slot to enhance personalization options. Minor alignment issues with the camera attachment were also addressed.

### Final Version
All elements were successfully integrated, including a refined fit, optimized button accessibility, and an improved detachable camera cover. The final design balanced durability, flexibility, and personalization, making it a practical and aesthetic solution.
