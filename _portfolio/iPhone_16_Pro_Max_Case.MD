## Project Overview
This project showcases a 3D-printed phone case for the iPhone 16 Pro Max, designed for optimal protection and usability. By leveraging TPU material and parametric modeling, the case ensures a snug fit, button accessibility, and customizable aesthetics.

## Design Features
- **Flexible TPU Construction:** Provides impact resistance while maintaining ease of installation.
- **Button Flaps:** Thin, responsive covers allow easy pressing without excessive force.
- **Raised Lip:** Protects the screen from direct contact with surfaces.
- **Detachable Camera Cover:** Ensures lens protection while allowing flat-bed printing.
- **SVG Personalization Slot:** Enables users to insert custom designs for added customization.

## Iterative Design Process
The design evolved through multiple iterations:
1. **Prototype 1:** Initial sizing based on Apple schematics, but had tight tolerances.
2. **Iteration 2:** Adjusted dimensions for better fit, refined button cutouts.
3. **Final Version:** Optimized accessibility, improved adhesion, and successfully integrated all features.

## Material and Printing Settings
- **Material:** TPU for flexibility and shock absorption.
- **Printer:** Creality K1C
- **Nozzle Temp:** 210-240°C
- **Bed Temp:** 30-60°C
- **Print Speed:** 20-30 mm/s
- **Supports:** Tree supports for efficient material usage.
