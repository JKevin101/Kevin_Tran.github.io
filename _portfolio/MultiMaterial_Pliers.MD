## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a functional, multi-material needle nose pliers using 3D printing techniques. The pliers are designed to grip and pick up through-hole resistors, leveraging the capabilities of print-in-place manufacturing and elastomeric materials for a flexible, spring-return mechanism.

Print-in-place models are innovative designs that function immediately after being printed without the need for additional assembly. These designs often rely on careful clearances between moving parts and precise print orientations. While single-material extrusion is common, adding a flexible component can greatly enhance functionality, creating smoother and more controlled movements.

## Design and Iterative Process
The needle nose pliers were designed with a three-part assembly to accommodate the capabilities of the available 3D printers. The components include:

- **Two rigid handles:** Printed from PLA for structural integrity.
- **Flexible spring element:** Made from 95A TPU, offering the necessary flexibility for a spring-back mechanism.

Initially, prototypes were printed to test the tolerances and the fit of the mating parts. Adjustments were made to the spring geometry to ensure sufficient flexibility while maintaining durability. The use of a hand-pressed assembly method allowed quick adjustments without requiring additional tools.

## Operation and Use
1. **Assembly:** No tools required; simply press the spring element into the designated slots on each handle.
2. **Testing:** Confirm the spring-back function and check for smooth movement.
3. **Use:** Grip and pick up through-hole resistors for testing and manipulation.
