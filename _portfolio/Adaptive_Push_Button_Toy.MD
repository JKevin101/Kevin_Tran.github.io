This project enhances the accessibility of a children's toy by modifying its built-in push button into a **larger, external push button**, making it easier for children with **Global Developmental Delay** and **Cerebral Palsy** to engage with the toy. These modifications enable children with **limited dexterity and cognitive delays** to experience **independent play** and **motor skill development**.

The project combines **basic hardware modification**, **electrical safety considerations**, and **child-friendly design**, demonstrating how simple changes can create **inclusive play opportunities**.

{% include gallery caption="The gallery above shows the original toy before modification, the modified toy with the external button, and the circuit diagram detailing the new external connection." %}

### Purpose and Features
- **Purpose**: To enhance toy accessibility for children with **limited motor control and cognitive delays** by replacing a small, embedded button with a **large, external push button**.
- **Key Features**:
    - External push button for **easier interaction**.
    - Retains **original toy functions** (lights, sounds, music).
    - Safe and **child-friendly wiring and button integration**.
    - Compliant with **ASTM F963-17 Toy Safety Standards**.

### Operation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
    - Open the toyâ€™s paw to expose the **original button wiring**.
    - Solder a **female connector** to the internal circuit.
    - Attach the **external push button** to the female connector.
    - Wrap exposed wires with **heat shrink tubing** for safety.
    - Reseal the paw with **needle and thread**, ensuring wiring is secure.

2. **Testing Process**:
    - Confirm the external button activates all original toy functions.
    - Perform **durability tests** (repeatedly dropping the toy) to check for functionality loss.
    - Check for **wire entanglement risks**, exposed wires, and loose connections.

3. **Compliance Checks**:
    - Ensure all modifications comply with:
        - **Cord length limits (<12 inches) to prevent entanglement**.
        - **Battery compartment safety (requires tool access)**.
        - **Strain relief to prevent stress on internal wires**.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how simple, **low-cost modifications** can make toys accessible for children with **physical and cognitive challenges**. By replacing a small, hard-to-press button with a **large external button**, the modified toy supports **independent play, cognitive development, and fine motor skill practice**, fostering inclusive play environments.
