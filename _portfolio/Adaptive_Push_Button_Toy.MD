## Overview
This project enhances the accessibility of a children's toy by replacing its small built-in push button with a larger, external push button. This modification makes it easier for children with **Global Developmental Delay** and **Cerebral Palsy** to engage with the toy, enabling independent play and motor skill development.

By incorporating basic hardware modifications, electrical safety considerations, and child-friendly design, this project demonstrates how simple adaptations can create inclusive play opportunities.

## Purpose and Features
- **Purpose:** Improve toy accessibility for children with limited motor control and cognitive delays by integrating a large external push button.
- **Key Features:**
  - Large external push button for easier interaction.
  - Retains original toy functions (lights, sounds, music).
  - Safe and child-friendly wiring and button integration.
  - Compliant with **ASTM F963-17 Toy Safety Standards**.

## Operation
### 1. Hardware Setup
- Open the toyâ€™s paw to expose the original button wiring.
- Solder a female connector to the internal circuit.
- Attach the external push button to the female connector.
- Wrap exposed wires with heat shrink tubing for safety.
- Reseal the paw with needle and thread, ensuring wiring is secure.

### 2. Testing Process
- Confirm the external button activates all original toy functions.
- Perform durability tests (e.g., repeated drops) to check functionality.
- Inspect for wire entanglement risks, exposed wires, and loose connections.

### 3. Compliance Checks
- Ensure all modifications comply with:
  - **Cord length limits (<12 inches)** to prevent entanglement.
  - **Battery compartment safety** (requires tool access).
  - **Strain relief measures** to prevent stress on internal wires.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **simple, low-cost modifications** can make toys more accessible for children with physical and cognitive challenges. By replacing a small, hard-to-press button with a large external button, the modified toy supports **independent play**, **cognitive development**, and **fine motor skill practice**, fostering an inclusive play environment.
