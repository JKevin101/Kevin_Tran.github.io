This innovative prosthetic device replicates natural hand movements by converting EMG signals from muscle activity into precise mechanical motion. Powered by MyoWare EMG sensors, an Arduino microcontroller, and five servo motors, the bionic hand provides lifelike articulation and responsiveness. An OLED display enhances usability by offering real-time feedback on muscle signals and system performance. Combining advanced bio-signal processing, hardware design, and software development, this project demonstrates a functional and accessible solution for improving prosthetic technology.

### Operation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - **EMG Sensor Placement**: Attach the MyoWare EMG sensors to the target muscle groups responsible for hand movements. Ensure proper skin contact for accurate signal detection.
   - **Circuit Assembly**: Connect the EMG sensors, servo motors, and OLED display to the Arduino board as per the provided circuit diagram in the [Circuit Diagram](https://github.com/JKevin101/Bionic_Hand/blob/5ccf55b6d32624cabfeccd29a5afa77dec50e408/README.md).

2. **Software Setup**:
   - **Arduino IDE**: Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
   - **Library Installation**: Within the Arduino IDE, install the necessary libraries:
     - `Servo.h` for controlling the servo motors.
     - `Wire.h`, `Adafruit_GFX.h`, and `Adafruit_SSD1306.h` for handling the OLED display.
   - **Code Upload**: Open the Arduino code from [Arduino Code](https://github.com/JKevin101/Bionic_Hand/blob/5ccf55b6d32624cabfeccd29a5afa77dec50e408/Bionic_Hand_Code/Bionic_Hand_Code.ino) and upload it to the Arduino board.

3. **System Calibration**:
   - **Power On**: Supply power to the Arduino board.
   - **Signal Monitoring**: Observe the OLED display for real-time feedback on EMG signal strength and system status.
   - **Threshold Adjustment**: If necessary, adjust the EMG signal thresholds in the code to match the user's muscle signal strength for optimal performance.

4. **Operation**:
   - **Muscle Activation**: Flex and extend the muscles where the EMG sensors are placed.
   - **Hand Movement**: The bionic hand should mimic the user's muscle movements in real time, providing lifelike articulation.
